      "\n",
      "Definition: PSP is a nervous system disease caused by eating cooked or raw shellfish that contain environmental toxins.\n",
      "\n",
      "Causes and Symptoms: The toxins are produced by a group of algae (dinoflagellates). The illness can cause a range of symptoms, including tingling lips, numbness in the fingers, toes, or limbs, difficulty speaking, and muscle weakness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Diagnosis: PSP diagnosis is based on symptoms after eating shellfish, even if the shellfish are adequately cooked. No blood or urine test is available to diagnose the illness. However, tests in mice to detect the toxin from the eaten fish can be done by public health officials.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment: The treatment of PSP is mostly supportive. If early symptoms are recognized, the doctor will try to flush the toxin from the gastrointestinal tract with medications that help stimulate bowel movements. However, there is no specific antidote\n"
